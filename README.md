# CW2USBKB
A project to hook up my keyer to my phone to use with Morse Mania.

Based largely on a project from Hackaday.io: https://hackaday.io/project/184702-morse-code-usbhid-interface-the-gadget

# The Plan

Using a seeeduino to convert keyer to keyboard presses. 
configure for Straight Key or Iambic
Morse Mainia or Vband
